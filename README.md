# ppx  
## A Python interface to the ProteomeXchange Repository  

The `ppx` package provides a simple means to access the ProteomeXchange repository from Python. Using PXD identifiers, the user can retrieve the metadata associated with a project and download project files.

`ppx` is largely based on the `rpx` R package by Laurent Gatto ([Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rpx.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lgatto/rpx)).

While `ppx` has not been released on the Python Package Index, you can install the development version directly from GitHub. The `ppx` package is only available for Python 3.5+.  

```
pip install git+git://github.com/wfondrie/ppx.git
```
